5) calculation():
    Count the number of moves and to tell the code how the game will end (i.e. Since there are 12 cards altogether, the game will end when totalScore is equal to 6.)

Unsolved problems/intended improvements in the future:
-giving user the choice to choose the number of cards (difficulty level).
-making it a multiplayer mode of users using two separate computers (live gaming).
-a point to each type of cards that are being matched.
-add an API to the search button so that users can learn more about each heroes and villains.
